<p class="whitespace">Once the CLI application is installed and setup, click <code>Fetch AWS CLI config</code> to load the CLI configuration.
Loading the configuration allows the configurator to prompt you with the right information when filling a Route 53 DNS record.
Make sure the information displayed below are up to date, otherwise the plugin might not be able to update the record.
You also need to make sure your profile has the appropriate rights in the IAM console to update Route53 records.
The installation instructions are available below.

			<li>
				Head to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home" target="_blank">AWS  Console</a> and go into IAM (use the search in the console to find the tool).
			</li>

			<li>
				<b><i>The step is optional, but is recommended for additional security.</i></b><br />
				Create a new policy and use the following JSON policy:<br />
				<code class="whitespace">{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "RecordWrite",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/*"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "HZList",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "route53:ListHostedZones",
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}</code><br />
				This policy allows the user to list route 53 hosted zones and to edit the hosted zones records.
			</li>

			<li>
				You'll need to setup a new user with <code>Programmatic access</code><br />
				and will need use the policy created during the last step.<br />
				If you've skipped the policy creation, you can attach the following policy: <code>AmazonRoute53FullAccess</code><br />
				Once the user is created, make sure to take note of the user's Access key ID and Secret access key, since those will be needed later.
			</li>

			<li>
				You'll need to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">install Python</a> to install the AWS CLI utility.<br />
				Follow the official instructions to install Python for your specific environment.
			</li>

			<li>
				In a commandline window run the following command:<br />
				<code>pip install awscli</code><br />
				If the terminal indicates <code>pip</code> was not found, you might need to restart your terminal<br />
				or python might not have been included in your PATH (which is essential).
			</li>

			<li>
				Setup your AWS CLI by running the following command and follow the instructions on screen:<br />
				<code>aws configure</code>
			</li>

			<li>
				Done, you can now use this plugin properly.
			</li>
